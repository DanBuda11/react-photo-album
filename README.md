##React Photo Album

This project was bootstrapped with [Create React App](https://github.com/facebookincubator/create-react-app).

Additional dependencies & devDependencies added include npm-run-all, react-router and Sass. Scripts updated to include sass-watch and a build that complies .scss files to .css.

While photo album data and images are hardcoded in, this is an example of setting state on the parent component and filtering all the information down to child components using only props and params to provide the data necessary to render everything to the screen.
