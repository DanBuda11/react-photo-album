##React Photo Album

A simple photo album made with React. While the album/photo info is hard-coded, this is an example of setting state on the main parent component and filtering all the information necessary down to child components using only props and params.

* Built with [create-react-app](https://github.com/facebookincubator/create-react-app)
* Also added npm-run-all, react-router and Sass
* Scripts updated to include sass-watch and .scss to .css compilation
